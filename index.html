        <div class="subheading mb-5">Marine BiologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I love Marine Biology. I have been so passionate about it since I took my AP Biology class in high school. My teacher really helped me become who I am and I really do thank her to this day because of that class and just how she taught. She is one of my main role models and why I am here today. I took AP Biology during my Junior year in high school. That is the class that made me change my mind about my future.
<br><br>

        If Iâ€™m being honest I just wanted to become a doctor and my counselor told me I should take that class so I did. I didnâ€™t even know that I had a passion for being a marine biologist or even thinking about it. I just wanted to be a good example for my parents to show them that I can succeed and become someone I look up to in life. We started watching documentaries about the ocean and how much of it really hasnâ€™t been explored yet. I just thought to myself that  I just remember to this day how extremely fascinated I was with watching it even though I thought most documentaries were boring. I actually enjoyed watching it and thatâ€™s when I knew that I was fascinated in becoming something different, or at least striving for it. I started looking up marine biology and what it really meant and it was honestly really interesting to me. I started looking up the salary and let me tell you they donâ€™t make too much but that doesnâ€™t really matter to me. 
<br><br>

        I donâ€™t want a job that will make me rich, I want a job that I am passionate about and a job that I can do and enjoy for the rest of my life. So many people want a job that pays well but they end up hating it in the end and I donâ€™t want that for me. I have always loved the ocean as a kid and I love going to the beach, I literally would go during the coldest times of the year and actually enjoy it. Many people tell me theyâ€™re afraid of the ocean, but I'm not. I want to know what is out there and I want to see it myself. I know it might be terrifying but I believe that is the most beautiful thing in the world because I would be able to find a new species or something and I can name it whatever I want. Like I said I have been fascinated about the ocean as a kid and I have been super interested in dinosaurs especially the ones in the ocean. They have just been so cool like they are literally really big animals that once lived on earth just like us. I feel like there is something like that out there still just waiting for someone to discover it in the ocean. I want to be that someone and that is what I am striving for.
